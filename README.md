# F25D Task 1
This is a simple login page I created as the first task in my Frontend Development class.
The task required creating a login page with CSS and HTML, but I added some JavaScript for fun.

I tried to logically group some of the elements together and have some spacing in between those grps (labels + related fields etc)
The login and register sections lie side by side on large screens, but wrap to be placed vertically on smaller screens.
