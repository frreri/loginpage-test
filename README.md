# F25D Task 1
This is a simple login page I created as the first task in my Frontend Development class.
The task required creating a login page with CSS and HTML, but I added some JavaScript for fun.

I tried to logically group some of the elements together and have some spacing in between those grps (labels + related fields etc)
The login and register sections lie side by side on large screens, but wrap to be placed vertically on smaller screens.

###### The HTML validates with no errors or warnings at validator.w3.org (there are some info messages regarding the traling slash /> on self closing tags that Prettier adds that i found annoying, but i learned that it isn't a problem and just info in case they were used for the wrong reason. Even code examples at MDN web docs use the trailing slashes and Prettier as formatter)
