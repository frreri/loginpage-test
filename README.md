# F25D Task 1
This is a simple login page I created as the first task in my Frontend Development class.
The task required creating a login page with CSS and HTML, but I added some JavaScript for fun.

I tried to logically group some of the elements together and have some spacing in between those grps (labels + related fields etc)
The login and register sections lie side by side on large screens, but wrap to be placed vertically on smaller screens.

###### The HTML validates with no errors or warnings at validator.w3.org (there are some info messages regarding the traling slash /> on self closing tags that Prettier adds, but that is not an issue and the HTML is still valid. Even code exmamples at MDN web docs use prettier and the trailing slashes)
